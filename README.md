Development of Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Design and Optimization Software
Phase I: Cycle Design and Analysis of Turbojet and Turbofan Engines for Subsonic Aircraft

Abstract: The objective is to develop an in-house aircraft engine design software to study the aircraft design process as well as for educational purpose and further research. Parametric cycle analysis is performed with the purpose to determine the performance of engines at different flight conditions, design choices, and design limit parameters. With parametric cycle analysis, the design software namely “GTA” or “Gas Turbine Analysis” is developed with the main purpose to perform a calculation from user requirements to get the data to select the appropriate or proper turbofan/turbojet engine for that requirement. The parametric cycle analysis performed in this project is aim to obtain these flight performance parameters namely specific thrust, thrustspecific fuel consumption, fuel/air ratio and efficiencies for performance analysis purpose as well as study the behavior of the range of design choices of compressor pressure ratio, free stream Mach number, fan pressure ratio, and bypass ratio. GTA is developed with Python source code as an open-source language. As a result, the function of the developed software as well as validation results are explained in this project, the behavior of variation of design choices that affect the performance of an engine is explained in detailed to exhibit the important of each design choices parameters. The further project progression is also mentioned to specify the limits of the software and direct the way of an improvement.
